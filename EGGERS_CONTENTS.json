In order to truly save this data, we must push to a remote server.\n\n```bash\n$ git push -u origin master\n```\n\nThis begs the question...where do we push to?!\n\nPerhaps this question isn't too difficult to answer - we may want to push to **GitHub**...but how? This is where **[SSH Git](#ssh-git)** comes into play.\n","idx":4},"ssh-git":{"content":"# SSH Git\n---\n","idx":5},"exercises":{"content":"# Exercises\n---\n\n","idx":6},"__list__":["home","title","desc","warmup","terminal-git","ssh-git","exercises"]}
